# Socket-Programming-TCP-and-UDP-Communication
TCP and UDP server-client implementations for reversing strings. It includes both TCP and UDP clients and servers, allowing users to send strings to the server, which then reverses the strings and sends them back to the client. This project is ideal for learning and demonstrating basic network programming concepts in Python.
